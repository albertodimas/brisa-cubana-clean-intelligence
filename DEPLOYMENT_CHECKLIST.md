## üîê GitHub Secrets Configuration

Configure in: `Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions`

### Staging Environment

- [ ] `RAILWAY_STAGING_TOKEN` - Railway API token for staging
- [ ] `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel deployment token
- [ ] `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID
- [ ] `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID (staging)

### Production Environment (REQUIRED)

‚ö†Ô∏è **These secrets are MANDATORY before running the production deployment workflow:**

- [ ] `RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_TOKEN` - Railway API token for production

- [ ] `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID for production project
- [ ] `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack webhook for deployment notifications (optional)

> **Note:** The `deploy-production` workflow will skip deployment jobs if required secrets are not configured. The workflow validates secrets before attempting deployment to prevent failures.

**How to obtain:**

```bash
# Railway token
railway login
railway whoami --token

# Vercel credentials
vercel login
cat .vercel/project.json  # After running 'vercel link'

# Slack webhook
# Go to: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks
# Create incoming webhook for your channel
```

   ```bash
   git revert [commit-hash]
   git push origin develop
   ```
