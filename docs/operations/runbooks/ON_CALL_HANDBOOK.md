## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: API Health Check Failing

**Symptoms:**

- `/health` endpoint returning 503
- PagerDuty alert: "API Down"
- Dashboard shows red status

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check if API is responding
curl https://api.brisacubana.com/health

# Check Railway service status
railway status --service api
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Database Connection Lost**

   ```bash
   # Check database status
   railway status --service postgres

   # If database is down, restart it
   railway restart --service postgres

   # Wait 30 seconds, then restart API
   railway restart --service api
   ```

2. **Service Crashed (OOM or Error)**

   ```bash
   # Check logs for crash reason
   railway logs --service api | tail -100

   # If OOM (Out of Memory), scale up
   railway up --service api --memory 2GB

   # Otherwise, restart service
   railway restart --service api
   ```

3. **Deployment Failed**

   ```bash
   # Check recent deployments
   railway deployments --service api

   # Rollback to previous working version
   railway rollback --service api
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Issue persists after 15 minutes
- Database corruption suspected
- Multiple services affected

---

### Issue 2: Web Application Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

- Users report blank page or 500 error
- Vercel showing errors
- PagerDuty alert: "Web Down"

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check Vercel deployment status
vercel ls --scope brisa-cubana

# Check for build errors
vercel logs --follow
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Build Failed**

   ```bash
   # Check latest deployment
   vercel inspect [deployment-url]

   # If build failed, redeploy
   vercel --prod

   # Or rollback to previous
   vercel rollback
   ```

2. **API Connection Failed**

   ```bash
   # Verify API is healthy
   curl https://api.brisacubana.com/health

   # Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable
   vercel env ls

   # If incorrect, update and redeploy
   vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
   ```

3. **CDN/Edge Issue**

   ```bash
   # Purge Vercel cache
   vercel cache clear

   # Check edge function logs
   vercel logs --edge
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Rollback doesn't resolve issue
- CDN provider outage (external dependency)
- Authentication system affected

---

### Issue 3: Database Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**

- Slow API responses (> 1 second)
- Database query timeouts
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Connect to database
railway connect postgres

# Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

# Find slow queries
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active'
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Connection Pool Exhausted**

   ```bash
   # Check connection count
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

   # If > 80% of max, kill idle connections
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'idle'
   AND now() - state_change > interval '10 minutes';
   ```

2. **Long-Running Query**

   ```bash
   # Find and kill long-running queries
   SELECT pg_cancel_backend(pid)
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE now() - query_start > interval '5 minutes';
   ```

3. **Missing Index or Bad Query**

   ```bash
   # Find missing indexes
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname
   FROM pg_indexes
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';

   # Check query execution plan
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE [slow-query];
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Database requires index creation (DBA needed)
- Database scaling required
- Data corruption suspected

---

### Issue 4: Payment Processing Failures

**Symptoms:**

- Stripe webhooks failing
- Payment confirmations not updating
- Users report payment issues

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check Stripe webhook deliveries
# Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks

# Check API webhook endpoint logs
railway logs --service api | grep "webhook"

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://api.brisacubana.com/api/payments/webhook \
  -H "stripe-signature: test" \
  -d '{}'
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Webhook Signature Verification Failed**

   ```bash
   # Verify STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correct
   railway variables --service api | grep STRIPE

   # Get correct secret from Stripe dashboard
   # Update environment variable
   railway variables --service api --set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[secret]

   # Restart API
   railway restart --service api
   ```

2. **Database Not Updating Payment Status**

   ```bash
   # Check payment records
   railway connect postgres

   SELECT * FROM "Payment"
   WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;

   # If stuck in PENDING, manually update (last resort)
   # UPDATE "Payment" SET status = 'COMPLETED' WHERE id = '[id]';
   ```

3. **Stripe API Rate Limited**

   ```bash
   # Check for 429 errors in logs
   railway logs --service api | grep "429"

   # Implement exponential backoff (code change required)
   # Escalate to backend team
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Payment data inconsistency detected
- Stripe API outage (check https://status.stripe.com)
- Financial discrepancy > $1000

---

### Issue 5: Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**

- Users cannot log in
- JWT token validation errors
- Session expired errors

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Test authentication endpoint
curl -X POST https://api.brisacubana.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test"}'

# Check for auth errors in logs
railway logs --service api | grep -i "auth\|jwt\|token"
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **JWT Secret Mismatch**

   ```bash
   # Verify JWT_SECRET in API
   railway variables --service api | grep JWT_SECRET

   # Verify NEXTAUTH_SECRET in Web
   vercel env ls | grep NEXTAUTH_SECRET

   # If mismatched, update and redeploy
   ```

2. **Token Expiration Issue**

   ```bash
   # Check JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRATION setting
   railway variables --service api | grep EXPIRATION

   # Default should be: 15m (access), 7d (refresh)
   ```

3. **Database Session Store Issue**

   ```bash
   # Check Session table
   railway connect postgres

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Session" WHERE "expiresAt" > NOW();

   # If sessions expired, users need to re-login (expected behavior)
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Security incident suspected (unauthorized access)
- Mass session invalidation required
- Auth provider (Auth.js) bug

---

### Issue 6: High Error Rate (> 5%)

**Symptoms:**

- Sentry showing spike in errors
- PagerDuty alert: "High Error Rate"
- Dashboard shows yellow/red status

**Quick Diagnosis:**

```bash
# Check error breakdown in Sentry
# Visit: https://sentry.io/organizations/brisa-cubana/issues/

# Check error logs
railway logs --service api | grep -i "error" | tail -50
```

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Recent Deployment Introduced Bug**

   ```bash
   # Check recent deployments
   railway deployments --service api

   # If error started after deployment, rollback
   railway rollback --service api
   ```

2. **External Service Outage**

   ```bash
   # Check third-party service status pages
   # - Stripe: https://status.stripe.com
   # - Twilio: https://status.twilio.com
   # - OpenAI: https://status.openai.com

   # If external service down, enable circuit breaker or degraded mode
   ```

3. **Increased Traffic (DDoS or Viral Event)**

   ```bash
   # Check request volume
   railway metrics --service api

   # If legitimate traffic spike, scale up
   railway up --service api --replicas 3

   # If DDoS, enable rate limiting or contact CDN provider
   ```

**Escalation Trigger:**

- Error rate > 10% for > 10 minutes
- Cannot identify root cause within 30 minutes
- Requires code fix (not config change)

---

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Alert Received (0-5 minutes)

**Immediate Actions:**

- [ ] Acknowledge alert in PagerDuty (within SLA)
- [ ] Open monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Check service health status
- [ ] Determine severity using decision tree

**Severity Assessment:**

- **Sev1:** Complete outage, data loss, security breach
- **Sev2:** Major degradation, critical feature broken
- **Sev3:** Minor impact, limited feature broken
- **Sev4:** Informational, no immediate impact

### 2. Initial Assessment (5-10 minutes)

**Investigation Steps:**

- [ ] Review recent changes (deployments, config, DNS)
- [ ] Check error logs (Sentry, Railway, Vercel)
- [ ] Review metrics (error rate, latency, traffic)
- [ ] Identify scope of impact (users affected, revenue impact)

**Document Findings:**

```markdown
[TIME] Initial Assessment:

- Severity: [Sev1/2/3/4]
- Impact: [Description]
- Scope: [X users / Y services affected]
- Started: [Timestamp]
- Potential Cause: [Hypothesis]
```

### 3. Declare Incident (If Sev1 or Sev2)

**Incident Declaration:**

- [ ] Create Slack channel: `#incident-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- [ ] Post incident announcement (use template)
- [ ] Update status page: https://status.brisacubana.com
- [ ] Notify stakeholders (support, product, leadership)

**Incident Announcement Template:**

```
ðŸš¨ SEV [1/2] INCIDENT DECLARED ðŸš¨

Summary: [Brief description]
Impact: [What's affected]
Started: [Timestamp]
Incident Commander: @[your-name]
Status Channel: #incident-[YYYYMMDD-HHMM]

Current Status: Investigating
ETA for Update: [15 minutes]

Status Page: [Updated/Pending]
Customer Notification: [Yes/No/Pending]
```

### 4. Mitigation (10-30 minutes)

**Priority: Stop the bleeding first**

**Common Mitigation Actions:**

- [ ] **Rollback deployment** (if recent change caused issue)

  ```bash
  railway rollback --service api
  vercel rollback
  ```

- [ ] **Scale resources** (if capacity issue)

  ```bash
  railway up --service api --replicas 3
  ```

- [ ] **Restart service** (if crash/hang)

  ```bash
  railway restart --service api
  ```

- [ ] **Kill problematic queries** (if database issue)

  ```sql
  SELECT pg_cancel_backend([pid]);
  ```

- [ ] **Enable degraded mode** (if third-party outage)
  - Disable non-critical features
  - Enable circuit breakers
  - Show maintenance message

**Document Actions:**

```markdown
[TIME] Mitigation Attempted:

- Action: [What you did]
- Result: [Success/Failed]
- Next Step: [What's next]
```

### 5. Communication (Throughout)

**Update Frequency:**

- **Sev1:** Every 15 minutes
- **Sev2:** Every 30 minutes
- **Sev3:** Every 2 hours

**Update Template:**

```
ðŸ”„ UPDATE [TIME]

Status: [Investigating/Mitigating/Monitoring/Resolved]
Actions Taken: [List]
Current Impact: [Description]
Next Update: [Time]
ETA for Resolution: [Estimate or "Unknown"]
```

**Status Page Updates:**

- Initial: "Investigating - We are aware of issues with [service]"
- Mitigation: "Identified - We have identified the issue and are working on a fix"
- Monitoring: "Monitoring - A fix has been applied and we are monitoring"
- Resolved: "Resolved - The issue has been resolved"

### 6. Resolution & Monitoring

**Confirm Resolution:**

- [ ] Health checks passing for 15 minutes
- [ ] Error rate back to normal (< 1%)
- [ ] Response time back to baseline
- [ ] No new related alerts

**Post-Resolution Actions:**

- [ ] Update status page to "Resolved"
- [ ] Post resolution message in incident channel
- [ ] Thank participants
- [ ] Close incident in PagerDuty
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem (within 48 hours)

**Resolution Template:**

```
âœ… INCIDENT RESOLVED

Summary: [Brief description]
Duration: [Start] - [End] ([Duration])
Root Cause: [Brief explanation]
Impact: [What was affected]
Resolution: [What fixed it]

Post-Mortem: Scheduled for [Date/Time]
Follow-up Actions: [JIRA links]

Thank you to @[contributors] for the swift response!
```

### 7. Escalation (If Needed)

**When to Escalate:**

- Issue persists after 30 minutes (Sev1) or 2 hours (Sev2)
- Root cause unclear
- Requires expertise outside your domain
- Requires architectural/business decision
- Security incident

**How to Escalate:**

```bash
# Tag relevant SME in incident channel
@backend-lead Need help with API performance issue

# If no response in 5 minutes, call directly
# Use PagerDuty to auto-escalate
```
