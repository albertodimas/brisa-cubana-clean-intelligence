## üîí Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability in Brisa Cubana Clean Intelligence:

1. **DO NOT** publish the vulnerability publicly
2. **Email:** security@brisacubanaclean.com (PGP key available on request)
3. **Include:**
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if known)
4. **Response Time:** Security team responds within **1 business day**
5. **Coordinated Disclosure:** We will work with you to establish a disclosure timeline

### Bug Bounty Program

We recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **Critical:** $500 - $2,000
- **High:** $200 - $500
- **Medium:** $50 - $200
- **Low:** Public recognition

**Eligibility:** First to report, responsible disclosure, actionable findings.

## üîê Supply Chain Security

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

We publish SBOMs for all container images:

- **Format:** SPDX 2.3 and CycloneDX 1.6
- **Generation:** Syft (Anchore) in CI/CD pipeline
- **Location:** GitHub Releases and Container Registry
- **Verification:** SBOM integrity validated with SHA256 checksums

**Download SBOMs:**

```bash
# Download latest SBOM
curl -L https://github.com/albertodimas/brisa-cubana-clean-intelligence/releases/latest/download/api-sbom.spdx.json
curl -L https://github.com/albertodimas/brisa-cubana-clean-intelligence/releases/latest/download/web-sbom.spdx.json
```

### Image Signing & Verification

All production images are signed with **Sigstore Cosign** (keyless signing):

- **Signing Certificate:** Ephemeral keys via GitHub OIDC
- **Transparency Log:** Public Rekor ledger
- **Verification:** Required before deployment

**Verify Image Signature:**

```bash
export COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1
cosign verify ghcr.io/albertodimas/brisa-cubana-clean-intelligence/api:latest \
  --certificate-identity-regexp="https://github.com/albertodimas/brisa-cubana-clean-intelligence" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
```

### Dependency Management

- **Automated Updates:** Dependabot daily scans
- **Pinned Versions:** All dependencies locked in `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Snyk + GitHub Security Advisories
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** Provenance attestations via SLSA framework (planned)

### Base Image Security

- **Distroless Images:** Minimal attack surface (no shell, no package manager)
- **Non-Root User:** All containers run as UID 65532 `nonroot`
- **Read-Only Filesystem:** Enforced by distroless + security context
- **Regular Updates:** Base images rebuilt weekly for security patches

## üö® Incident Response

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Impact                                 | Response Time  | Examples                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Sev1** | Critical - service down or data breach | **5 minutes**  | Database compromised, payment system down |
| **Sev2** | Major - degraded service               | **15 minutes** | Elevated error rate, partial outage       |
| **Sev3** | Minor - limited impact                 | **1 hour**     | Non-critical feature broken               |

### Emergency Contact

- **Email:** security@brisacubanaclean.com
- **Phone:** +1 (786) 796-2201 (24/7 emergency hotline)
- **PagerDuty:** https://brisacubana.pagerduty.com
- **Slack:** `#security-incidents` (internal)

### Incident Process

1. **Detection:** Automated alerts or manual report
2. **Triage:** Security team assesses severity (< 15 min)
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication:** Remove threat, patch vulnerability
5. **Recovery:** Restore services, verify integrity
6. **Post-Mortem:** Root cause analysis within 48 hours

## üîç Security Scanning (CI/CD)

Every code change triggers automated security checks:

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- **Secret Detection:** TruffleHog OSS (verified secrets only)
- **SAST:** CodeQL (security-and-quality query suite)
- **Dependency Scan:** Snyk (fails on critical/high vulnerabilities)
- **Container Scan:** Trivy (OS + app vulnerabilities)
- **Policy Checks:** OPA/Conftest (Dockerfile best practices)
- **SBOM Generation:** Syft (SPDX + CycloneDX)
- **Image Signing:** Cosign keyless signing

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`

### Security Gates

Deployments are **blocked** if:

- ‚ùå Critical/High vulnerabilities detected
- ‚ùå Secrets found in code
- ‚ùå Policy violations (e.g., running as root)
- ‚ùå SBOM generation fails
- ‚ùå Image signature verification fails
