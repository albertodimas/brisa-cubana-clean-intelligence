## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Node.js Version Warning**
   - Expected: Node 22.x
   - Actual: Node 24.9.0
   - Impact: None (newer version compatible)
   - Action: Informational only

2. **HTTP Metrics Display**
   - Status: Metrics endpoint working, custom HTTP metrics in development
   - Impact: Low - Core observability functional
   - Action: Phase 2 enhancement in progress

### Recommendations

1. **High Priority**
   - Configure external OTLP endpoint (Jaeger/Tempo) for tracing
   - Set up Alertmanager for Slack/PagerDuty notifications
   - Implement automated database backups

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Enable distributed rate limiting with Redis
   - Configure log aggregation (Loki/Elasticsearch)
   - Optimize bundle size for calendar page (187 KB → < 150 KB)

3. **Low Priority**
   - Add more E2E test scenarios (current: 15, target: 30)
   - Document custom deployment workflows
   - Create video walkthrough of admin features
