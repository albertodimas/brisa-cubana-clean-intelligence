# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) where applicable.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-11

### Added

- Reusable GitHub Actions workflow (`project-pipeline.yml`) that standardizes checkout, dependency installation, Prisma preparation, linting, type checking, unit tests, build, and Playwright execution across PR, main, and nightly runs.
- Composite Action `.github/actions/setup-project` to configure Node.js, pnpm, Prisma, Playwright, and runtime environment variables with consistent fallbacks.
- Security automation with dedicated `codeql.yml` (push/PR/scheduled static analysis) and `dependency-review.yml` (PR dependency diff scanning).

### Changed

- Updated `ci.yml`, `pr-checks.yml`, and `nightly.yml` to consume the reusable pipeline, enabling secret scanning, database preparation toggles, and conditional Playwright artifact uploads without duplicated YAML.
- Refreshed `docs/status.md` to describe the new workflow topology, CodeQL coverage, and dependency review gate.

### Removed

- Duplicate workflow steps for pnpm setup, Prisma generation, environment variable exporting, and repeated build commands in individual workflows.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-09

- Refer to repository history for the previous release baseline.
